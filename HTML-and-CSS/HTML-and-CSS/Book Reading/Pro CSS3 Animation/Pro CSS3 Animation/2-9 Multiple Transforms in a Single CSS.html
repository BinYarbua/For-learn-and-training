			While CSS Animations can be used to alter almost every aspect of an HTML element (with the exception of the 
properties listed in the previous chapter), some of the most powerful means of manipulating the presentation of 
web pages lie in the CSS Transforms and Transitions modules, which are entirely new in CSS3.
CSS Transitions are the very simplest form of animation: a movement between two states. Once you master 
the fundamental syntax for transitions described in this chapter, you will be able to apply simple, effective 
animations to images (described in Chapter 3) and user interface elements (described in Chapter 4), and then 
begin to create more complex keyframed animations (described in Chapter 5 and beyond)
